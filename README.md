This is a fork of thexyz's mod xDoors2.
Only the player who placed the door may open, close and dig it up.
In theory. Hasn't been tested on multiplayer so far.

Take the textures from the xdoor2-mod.

--

xdoors2l.lua is a version that works with the new locks-Mod and
allows more complex locking (i.e. allowing specivied players to use
the door as well). How to use:
- download and install the locks-mod
- move xdoors2l.lua to init.lua
- create a file depends.txt with the content "locks"

All this has not been tested much so far! Use at your own risk.
